# Exercise with Data and APIs in JS

These exercises are focused on handling asynchronous events with Promises etrieve, collect, and store data. They will initially focus on how to load data with the fetch()-function on the client-side. The rest of the exercises will be more "full-stack" and include server-side programming implementing API authentication and working with node.js.
